# pygame_rocketball

A short game I made in a day to start learning how to use pygame.  

Heavily modified version of [this example](http://www.pygame.org/docs/tut/intro/intro.html)

Hit the spacebar to accellerate the ball upwards.  

The right dial shows how much fuel you have, the left dial shows how quickly the fuel in your tank will be replenished.  

Using the engine will gradually reduce its ability to replenish its fuel.  Using the engine with an empty tank will greatly damage the replenishment ability.  

The central indicator gives the speed (within a certain range of 0) and direction of the ball.  

See how high you can get!
